## Summary
_The TL;DR._ Simply describe the outcome the proposed change intends to achieve. This should be non-technical and accessible to a casual community member.
## Abstract
_The What._ A short (~200 word) description of the proposed change. This is what will be done if the ZEIP is implemented, not why it should be done or how it will be done. If the ZEIP proposes deploying a new contract, write, "we propose to deploy a new contract that will do x".
## Motivation
_The Why._ This is the problem statement, and it is critical that you explain why the change is needed, preferably with objective data. This is not the place to describe how the ZEIP will address the issue. Compelling problem statements are the raison d'Ãªtre of ZEIPs. 
## Specification
_The How._ The following sections describe how the change is being designed and will be implemented. 
### Overview
This is a high level overview of how the ZEIP will solve the problem, including how the proposed change (such as adding a new feature) will be implemented. Additional implementation details will be required prior formally submitting the ZEIP for an onchain vote to adopt the change.
### Rationale
This is where you explain the reasoning behind how you propose to solve the problem. Although the answers may be preliminary while development is still nascent, they should demonstrate a thoughtful approach to the design space. Why do you propose to implement the change in this way, what are the considerations and trade-offs. The rationale fleshes out what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. 
### Technical Specification
This is where you describe the syntax and semantics of the proposed implementation. Additional implementation details will be required when the ZEIP is formally proposed. 
## Security Considerations
Describe any known security-relevant design factors and decisions.
## Notes
Include any relevant links or references.
## Team
Identify your team and any relevant background that makes you qualified to perform the work. 
## Point of Contact
Indicate who will be mainly responsible for answering questions and provide their contact information.
## Funding Requested
Generally, funding is limited to $25k per request. However, larger amounts will be considered with the appropriate justification. Estimate the total amount of funding you expect to need to complete the work, i.e., a ZEIP ready for an onchain vote, and describe how the amount requested at this time will be used.
